            <h1>Sunstat.us: Target Audience </h1>
            
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>The target audience for Sunstat.us is those who are needing the facts quickly.</p>
            <h2>Persona 1: The Elderly</h2>
                <p>The first target audience is elderly people who primarily use a desktop computer. When I think of this, 
                    I think of my grandmother. She often uses her computer to check the weather because she is more comfortable 
                    doing it on there than on her smart phone. This requires that the layout be simple and easy to understand,
                     with large text that contrasts well with the background. They expect the information to be easy to find and easy
                      to understand.</p>
            <h2>Persona 2: On The Go</h2>
                <p>The second group of people that would be greatly served by Sunstat.us is those who use their smartphones primarily
                    and are on the go. They will want to take a quick look at the weather and know what to expect before they rush out the door.
                    
                </p>
            
            <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
                <h3>Scenario 1 - Grandmother</h3>
                    <p>A grandmother is not comofrtable with a smartphone, but she is used to using her PC. She uses it to navigate to 
                        Sunstat.us and check the weather before taking her grandkids to the beach.
                    </p>
                <h3>Scenario 2 - Soccer Practice</h3>
                    <p>A parent pulls out their phone and checks the weather before shuttling the kids to soccer practice. It looks like it will
                        be hotter than normal, so she decides to bring along some extra water.
                    </p>
                <h3>Scenario 3 - Jogger</h3>
                    <p>A gentleman has set a goal to run every day this upcoming week. He wants to know when the best time to run will be, so that it's not too hot out.
                        He uses his smartphone to check the 7 day forecast.
                    </p>
                <h3>Scenario 4 - Fisherman</h3>
                    <p>A fisherman is making plans to take his boat out on the lake and needs to make sure there is no stormy weather that will sneak up on the horizon.
                        He has large, rugged hands, which can make it difficult to navigate his smart phone. Sunstat.us's minimalistic design reduces the clutter, though,
                        and helps him the information he needs.
                    </p>
                <h3>Scenario 5 - Poor eyesight</h3>
                    <p>A user has poor eyesight. They would normally use the weather app built into their phone, but the black letters blend into the
                        blue background. They decide to use Sunstat.us because the large black letters contrast very well with the yellow background.
